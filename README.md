# Auctions

From a high level point of view the demo consists of a list of auctions, where each auction has its own detail.

As an investor, I want to be able to use an iOS app to list all the auctions available in the marketplace.

Then, when I select a particular auction, I want to be able to see the estimated return amount so that I can decide whether to invest.

The list of auctions available can be retrieved by a `GET` request to this endpoint:
